      content: "I’ve spent more than a decade helping people solve technical problems in real-time. At Weill Cornell Medicine, I supported researchers and staff across Linux and Windows environments, often stepping in when time was critical. At Estée Lauder, I helped keep over 450 retail stores running by troubleshooting Oracle Xstore POS systems and resolving network issues. Across all these roles, I learned that listening to the user is as important as fixing the system."

      content: "From scripting to server deployments, I’ve been the person teams rely on to keep infrastructure reliable. At Cornell, I automated patching and updates with Python and PowerShell, cutting routine maintenance time in half. At Amazon Japan, I worked with secure hardware decommissioning inside data centers, where following strict security protocols was just as important as the technical work itself."

      content: "Security has been a growing focus for me. I built a home SOC lab using Wazuh, Suricata, and ELK Stack, where I practice threat detection and log analysis against simulated attacks. I also hold certifications including Security+ and Linux Foundation LFCS, and I’m applying those skills to real-world troubleshooting every day."

      content: "Wherever I’ve worked, I’ve made sure that fixes don’t just solve today’s problem, but help the team tomorrow. I’ve written SOPs, internal guides, and troubleshooting docs so others can step in quickly. Clear communication — both technical and non-technical — has been one of my best tools."
