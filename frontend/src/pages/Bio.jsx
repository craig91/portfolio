        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>        I’m Craig Dejean — an infrastructure-minded developer and technical support pro turned cloud security enthusiast. I have experience in scripting, system administration, and building virtualized lab environments. My passion is understanding how the internet works at its deepest layers, and helping others secure and scale their systems.</p>
        <p> I’m currently exploring opportunities in customer-facing engineering roles where I can apply my knowledge of DNS, WAFs, TLS, and Zero Trust architecture.
